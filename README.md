[![NPM Status](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/yt-dlp-exec.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yt-dlp-exec)

> A simple Node.js wrapper for [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

## My Work
It's a fork of [youtube-dl-exec](https://github.com/microlinkhq/youtube-dl-exec) which uses yt-dlp as his default binary instead of youtube-dl because youtube-dl doesn't seem to be maintained anymore.

## How it works
This package works exactly like his origin [youtube-dl-exec](https://github.com/microlinkhq/youtube-dl-exec). If you know how to use the original, you know how to use this one. Just be aware that youtube-dl and yt-dlp are slightly different so go check the documentation to know which commands can be performed here.
